Lisa's Sausage & Red Pepper Pasta
---------------------------------
Ingredients:
1 medium white or yellow onion
2 cloves garlic
2 medium green bell peppers
1 medium red bell pepper
3/4 lb. pasta (rigatoni or your favorite shape)
1/2 (19 oz.) package Italian sausage (hot, sweet, or mild)
1/2 Tbsp dried basil
1/4 tsp crushed red pepper (optional)

Time: 35 minutes
Servings: 8

Directions:
1. Add the vegetable oil and sausage links (unsliced) to a large pot.
3. While the sausage is cooking, thinly slice the bell peppers and onions, and mince the garlic.
4. Once the sausage is browned, remove it from the pot and add the peppers, onions, and garlic.
6. After the peppers and onions have softened, return the sliced sausage to the pot along with the diced tomatoes, basil, oregano, and crushed red pepper.
7. Stir to combine and continue to cook over medium heat.
8. Meanwhile, bring a large pot of water to a boil and cook the pasta for about 7 minutes, or just until tender, but still firm. Slightly undercook the pasta as it will continue to cook and soak up liquid once added to the pot with the sausage and peppers.
9. Once the pasta is finished cooking, drain it in a colander and then add it to the pot with the sausage and peppers.
