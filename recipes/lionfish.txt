Lisa's Sausage & Red Pepper Pasta
---------------------------------
Servings: 8

3/4 lb. pasta (rigatoni or your favorite shape)
1 Tbsp vegetable oil
1 medium red bell pepper
1 medium yellow bell pepper
1/2 Tbsp dried oregano

2. Cook over medium heat until the sausage is browned and firm enough to slice. It doesn't have to be cooked through at this point.
4. Once the sausage is browned, remove it from the pot and add the peppers, onions, and garlic.
5. Let them cook while you slice the sausage into thin medallions.
6. After the peppers and onions have softened, return the sliced sausage to the pot along with the diced tomatoes, basil, oregano, and crushed red pepper.
